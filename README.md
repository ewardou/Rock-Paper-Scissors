Rock-Paper-Scissors game project done with the objective of practising the basic concepts of JavaScript. The initial commits contained only the JS code and the game was played from the console. 
Later on, after reading and learning a bit about the DOM and its manipulation, I added a basic UI for the game to be played from the window. There is a score sheet, a message box, and three buttons the player can click to select his/her option and start the game.
When either the player or cpu reaches 5 points, the game ends and a reset button is displayed to start again.
